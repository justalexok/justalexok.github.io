<h1> Third intro </h1>Hi everyone! I'm Viktorija and this is my very first post on my cooking blog!<br />
<br />
	I'm a busy mum, who loves to cook and create foodie recipes. My passion for cooking and sharing recipes has led me to creating this blog!<br />
<br />
	As well as being a mum and chef, I've recently developed a keen interest in web design, and am currently studying it! Juggling these responsibilities has been a challenge, but I'm determined to make a success of my blog, studying, and being a mum.<br />
<br />
	I'm excited to be part of the blogging community and share my progress, the food I'm creating, and the knowledge and stories I acquire on this journey.<br />
<br />
	Thank you for being part of the journey!</body>
