<h1> Third intro </h1>Hi everyone!<br />
<br />
I'm Viktorija and I am a passionate cook, a devoted mum, and a fledgling web designer. This blog is my attempt at virtually bringing together my many obligations and expressions of passion. <br />
<br />
As a mum, I have to keep up with my son and all the obligations of parenthood while also making sure I stay up to date with all the newest developments in the world of web design. It's been a juggling act lately, but I'm managing to keep all the balls in the air and still find time for what I love the most - cooking! <br />
<br />
Cooking has been my passion since I was a child. I love trying out new recipes, making traditional dishes from my family's heritage, and discovering new flavours and ingredients along the way. I feel like cooking is a creative art form that has endless possibilities and I'm on a never-ending journey to discover just what I can create. <br />
<br />
I'm enjoying how this blog allows me to document my culinary and web design adventures. I'm excited to share all my experiences with you and I hope that you enjoy following me on my journey!<br />
<br />
Happy cooking!<br />
<br />
