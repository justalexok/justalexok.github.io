<h1> Second intro </h1>Hi everyone! <br />
<br />
My name is Viktorija and I’m delighted to have you here on my cooking blog. I have a passion for cooking and sharing delicious recipes with all of you. I am also a busy mum to two little boys and a student of web design. Balancing all of these aspects of my life can be a challenge at times, however I have found a way to do it successfully. I find comfort and joy in cooking and it has become my escape from the day-to-day rush of motherhood and studying. <br />
<br />
I take my cooking seriously and love using seasonal and local ingredients. I believe in a holistic experience, making sure the food I present to you all not only looks and tastes good but also brings joy. I hope that you will enjoy my recipes as much as I enjoy creating them and sharing them with you. <br />
<br />
I am excited about my future with my blog and to see what great new recipes I will develop. Thanks for joining me on my cooking journey. I look forward to sharing my love for food with all of you! <br />
<br />
Happy Cooking! <br />
