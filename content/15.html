<h1> Life of a super mum </h1>Hi everyone! My name is Viktorija and I am a certified chef and a mother of two wonderful kids, living in Auckland, New Zealand. <br />
<br />
I'm here to share my life and my passions - cooking, design, and motherhood - with you all. <br />
<br />
My love affair with cooking began when I was a little girl, helping my mother in the kitchen. I would watch and learn, trying to recreate her delicious recipes once I was old enough. <br />
<br />
Eventually, I decided to follow my passion and trained to become a chef. Being a practicing chef, the food industry and the creation of amazing food is something I'm very passionate about.<br />
<br />
When I became a mother I had to put my professional ambitions on the back-burner so that I could dedicate my time to my children, but that hasn't stopped me from cooking. Whenever I can, I like to get in the kitchen and create something new. <br />
<br />
I wanted to continue to pursue my love of cooking, so I decided to start a cooking blog! Here I have the freedom to experiments and share my recipes with a community of likeminded individuals. <br />
<br />
I'm also passionate about web design and recently started to take courses to learn more. In my spare time I've been designing my own website, and learning more about web design techniques - which is something I really enjoy! <br />
<br />
So here I am; a super mum juggling being a chef, a mother and a student, and I'm doing it all with a smile on my face. <br />
<br />
I hope that by sharing my blog, I can bring some light into your day and maybe inspire you to try something new.<br />
<br />
Thanks for joining me on this journey,<br />
Viktorija</body>
